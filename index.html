    <h1>Cryptocurrency liquidity</h1>
    <p>
      This site measures the liquidity of cryptocurrencies. Liquidity is measured as the amount of
      USD that can be exchanged for a given cryptocurrency while moving the price in any
      market by at most 0.5%.
    </p>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      The chart below gives an overview of cryptocurrency liquidity as measured within the last 24 hours.
      It includes the 200 most liquid cryptocurrencies.<br>
      <br>
      In this chart, a round shape
      denotes a cryptocurrency. The size of the shape is proportional to the liquidity of the given cryptocurrency.
      Yellow squares denote national currencies (e.g. USD, EUR, JPY). A line between two currencies denotes a market.
      For example, a line from BTC to USD denotes the BTC/USD market. The width of the line is proportional
      to the liquidity of the given market.
    </p>

    <h2>Evolution over time</h2>
    <p>
      Whereas the above graph show only present liquidity, the chart below shows the evolution of liquidity over time.<br>

      The table below shows the various markets through which one can buy and sell <span id="path_crypto">a cryptocurrency</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, the path <tt>BTC --bitfinex--> UST --bitfinex--> USD</tt> denotes selling BTC in exchange for UST
      in the Bitfinex BTC/UST market, and then selling the acquired UST for USD in the Bitfinex UST/USD market.
